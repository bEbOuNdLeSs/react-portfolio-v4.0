        I am a front-end web developer with 9 years of working experience in
        fields like sales, customer support, social media, and management. I
        combine my management expertise with technical skills and fully commit
        to consistency, meeting deadlines, and utilizing all available resources
        to achieve results. I enjoy creating beautiful, accessible, and
        responsive websites using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Sass, SCSS, Vanilla
        JavaScript, and React. Effective use of time, problem-solving, and
        communication skills help me show a positive attitude in complex
        situations, and my desire to learn quickly adapts me to changing
        situations.
